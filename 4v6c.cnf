c Simplified 2x2 Sudoku - each cell has variables for each possible value
c x_ij_k means cell (i,j) has value k
c Variables: x_11_1=1, x_11_2=2, x_12_1=3, x_12_2=4
c
c Each cell must have exactly one value (at least one):
c Cell (1,1): x_11_1 OR x_11_2
c Cell (1,2): x_12_1 OR x_12_2
c
c Each cell must have exactly one value (at most one):
c Cell (1,1): NOT(x_11_1 AND x_11_2) = (NOT x_11_1 OR NOT x_11_2)
c Cell (1,2): NOT(x_12_1 AND x_12_2) = (NOT x_12_1 OR NOT x_12_2)
c
c Row 1 must contain value 1 exactly once:
c (x_11_1 OR x_12_1) AND NOT(x_11_1 AND x_12_1)
